Porposed question by the teacher as homework:

Â¿Which kind of algorithms could we use in a path with moving objects?

We could solve this by using algorithms with real time updates combined 
with heuristic, that way we could have an updated view of the pathgraphf 
and chose which path is better, a good example of this would be to combine
Greedy Best-first Search with as I said a real time update of the 
pathgrahf.
